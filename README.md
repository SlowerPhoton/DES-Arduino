<h1> DES implementation on Arduino </h1>

<p>
Minimalist implementation of the DES algorithm. In this project I trade speed for memory: i.e. I store 8 booleans into one byte.

User can control the application by interacting with the main menu using buttons on the LCD display.

<h1> Enigma cipher for Arduino </h1>

<p>

Enables user to encrypt text using an Arduino with LCD display (with built-in controls). It can be operated using a user-friendly menu, where user can set shift of rotors, encryption/decryption key or enter the actual message. Output is printed to the LCD screen.
